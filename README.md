# Space Tourism SCSS
live website: https://fath-nasrudin.github.io/space-tourism-scss

This project is SCSS version of [space-tourism-css](https://github.com/fath-nasrudin/space-tourism-css)

Its challenge for me to create what I have done with [space-tourism-css](https://github.com/fath-nasrudin/space-tourism-css), but with SCSS as the preprocessor.
