# Space Tourism SCSS
live website: https://fath-nasrudin.github.io/space-tourism-scss

This project is SCSS version of [space-tourism-css](https://github.com/fath-nasrudin/space-tourism-css)

Its challenge for me to create what I have done in [space-tourism-css](https://github.com/fath-nasrudin/space-tourism-css), but with SCSS. 

## What I have learned
- SCSS variables
- SCSS modules
- SCSS mixins
- SCSS functions
- 7-1 folder pattern
- utility classes
- BEM methodology
